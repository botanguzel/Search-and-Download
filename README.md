# Google Search API Project

Welcome to the Google Search API Project! This project utilizes the Google Search Engine API and Google Custom Search Engine ID to perform searches based on user input. It allows users to specify the search query, the number of results to retrieve, and, if desired, advanced search options such as image type, color, type, image size, and dominant color. The retrieved results are then downloaded for further use.
